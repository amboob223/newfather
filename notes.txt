// okay we gon set it up like this 
    health
        -we have a button to take the initial time annd then return a list of shedheule times to feed 
        - we log the daily diaper count
        - we have a button to display the appointments her name and nubmber
         and see the average on a chart 
        

    wealth 
        - have a get button for all the info 
        - we track the total of all investments 
        - have an array off all investments and be able to dlete from the total too
        - make a text area for the finicial plan 

    shelf 
        - have a get button that pull ups all the info 


    index this part we need a get quote part and a search for child component like the other append
    -after we finish this we need to make an auth part 


    okay we need the feedtimes to inctrease by 2000 and go into an array of times an we put in a new array 

    we should have made it whwere it tracks daily progress right now the data just collects cross refrence data not time series data 

    im thinking for the quote part we have a collection of data and a random number and when the person click on that button they get a random selection 
    before the slection was based off intrest but we forgot to include that in our data and service request so for now it will be purley random quotes and activities 

    maybe we get the data from an external page and the quotes too once we do this we can design and make a logo and deploy this app for the fathers
    the next app will incorpiorate some auth in it
